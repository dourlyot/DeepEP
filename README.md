## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Message Sending

Here’s a basic example of sending a message between two nodes.

```c
#include <deepep.h>

int main() {
    deepEP_init();

    int receiver_id = 1;
    char message[] = "Hello, DeepEP!";
    
    deepEP_send(receiver_id, message);
    
    deepEP_finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Broadcasting a Message

You can also broadcast messages to all connected nodes.

```c
#include <deepep.h>

int main() {
    deepEP_init();

    char message[] = "Hello, everyone!";
    
    deepEP_broadcast(message);
    
    deepEP_finalize();
    return 0;
}
```
